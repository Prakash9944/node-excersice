# what is atatus

  # Atatus is a monitoring and performance management tool designed to help developers maintain the health, performance, and reliability of their applications.

  # Application Performance Monitoring (APM): Atatus provides detailed insights into how applications are performing, helping to identify slow transactions, performance bottlenecks, and errors at the code level. This allows for quick troubleshooting and optimization.

  # Real User Monitoring (RUM): This feature helps in understanding how real users are interacting with your application. It tracks user sessions, page load times, and user experiences to ensure that end-users are receiving the best possible performance.

  # Atatus automatically captures and tracks errors and exceptions in real-time, providing detailed information about where the error occurred and the context around it. This helps developers fix issues quickly before they impact users.

  # Logging: Atatus provides a centralized logging platform where all logs can be aggregated, searched, and analyzed. This makes it easier to track down issues and understand the behavior of the application over time.


# what is Replaybird

  # ReplayBird  is a powerful front-end monitoring and analytics tool that helps developers understand how users interact with their web applications. It provides a combination of session replay, performance monitoring, and error tracking, giving you the ability to see exactly what users experience and troubleshoot issues more effectively.

  # API Request Monitoring: records all network requests made by the application, including API calls, their responses, and any associated errors. This helps you diagnose backend issues and understand how they impact the user experience.
  # Session Replay: ReplayBird records user sessions on your website, allowing you to watch a video-like playback of how users navigate through your site. This includes clicks, scrolls, mouse movements, form interactions, and more. It’s like watching over the user’s shoulder to see exactly how they interact with your site.

  # Conversion Funnels: ReplayBird allows you to set up conversion funnels to track how users move through key stages of your website, such as from landing page to checkout. By analyzing where users drop off in the funnel, you can identify and fix obstacles that are preventing conversions.

  # You can track specific events on your website, such as button clicks, form submissions, or any other user interactions. This provides detailed analytics on how often these events occur and how they impact user experience and conversions.

  # ReplayBird also captures JavaScript errors and other issues that users may encounter during their sessions. This feature helps you quickly identify and fix technical issues that could be affecting user experience.
