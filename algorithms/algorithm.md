# Algorithm language independent

# Time complexity:
    # Time complexity is a measure of how an algorithm's runtime scales with the size of the input.

# Space complexity
    # Space complexity is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of the input.


# Worst-Case Complexity: The maximum time or space an algorithm takes for the largest possible input.

# Average-Case Complexity: The expected time or space complexity for a typical input.

# Best-Case Complexity: The minimum time or space an algorithm takes for the smallest or most favorable input.

    Example: Binary Search Binary Search O(1) if the target element is at the middle of the array.
